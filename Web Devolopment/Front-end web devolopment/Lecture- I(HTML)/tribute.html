    </cite> (or Viṣṇu, Sanskrit: विष्णु) means 'all pervasive'[17] and, according to Medhātith (c. 1000 CE), 'one who is everything and inside everything'.[18] Vedanga scholar Yaska (4th century BCE) in the Nirukta defines Vishnu as viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā ('one who enters everywhere'); also adding atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati ('that which is free from fetters and bondage is Vishnu').[19]

        In the tenth part of the Padma Purana (4-15th century CE), Danta (Son of Bhīma and King of Vidarbha) lists 108 names of Vishnu (17.98–102).[20] These include the ten primary avatars (see Dashavarara, below) and descriptions of the qualities, attributes, or aspects of God.
        
        The Garuda Purana (chapter XV)[21] and the "Anushasana Parva" of the Mahabharata both list over 1000 names for Vishnu, each name describing a quality, attribute, or aspect of God. Known as the Vishnu Sahasranama, Vishnu here is defined as 'the omnipresent'.
        
        Other notable names in this list include :
        <ul>
       <li>Hari</li> 
        <li>Lakshmikanta</li> 
        <li> Jagannatha</li>
        <li>Janardana</li> 
        <li> Govinda</li>
        <li>Hrishikesha</li> 
        <li>Padmanabha</li> 
        <li>Mukunda</li> 
        <li>Narayana</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="Iconography">Iconography</h2>
    <p>vishnu iconography shows him with dark blue, blue-grey or black coloured skin, and as a well-dressed jewelled man. He is typically shown with four arms, but two armed representations are also found in Hindu texts on artworks.[22][23]

        The historic identifiers of his icon include his image holding a conch shell (shankha named Panchajanya) between the first two fingers of one hand (left back), a chakra – war discus named Sudarshana – in another (right back). The conch shell is spiral and symbolizes all of interconnected spiraling cyclic existence, while the discus symbolizes him as that which restores dharma with war if necessary when cosmic equilibrium is overwhelmed by evil.[22] One of his arms sometimes carries a gada (club, mace named Kaumodaki) which symbolizes authority and power of knowledge.[22] In the fourth arm, he holds a lotus flower (padma) which symbolizes purity and transcendence.[22][23][24] The items he holds in various hands vary, giving rise to twenty four combinations of iconography, each combination representing a special form of Vishnu. Each of these special forms is given a special name in texts such as the Agni Purana and the Padma Purana. These texts, however, are inconsistent.[25] Rarely, Vishnu is depicted bearing the bow Sharanga or the sword Nandaka. He is depicted with the Kaustubha gem in a necklace and wearing Vaijayanti, a garland of forest flowers. The shrivatsa mark is depicted on his chest in the form of a curl of hair. He generally wears yellow garments. He wears a crown called the Kiritamukuta.[26]
        
        Vishnu iconography shows him either in standing pose, seated in a yoga pose, or reclining.[23] A traditional depiction of Vishnu is that of him reclining on the coils of the serpent Shesha, accompanied by his consort Lakshmi, as he "dreams the universe into reality."[27]
        
        Vishnu was associated with the sun because he used to be "a minor solar deity but rose in importance in the following centuries."[28]</p>
